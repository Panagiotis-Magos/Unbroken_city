#Concepts
France: Choose degree of original balkanisation. 4 Dutchies is less initial work
France:The default route is southern unification through Occitania.
This gives cores on Catalonia, Dauphine, (Vaskonia?)
Alternate route is northern unification through one of the dutchies. This
gives cores on Brittany, Picardy, Champagne.
Maybe all get cores on Champagne?
Cultures, French-Breton, Occitan-Catalan for sure. Dauphine(?), Picardois(?) for extra claims?
Maybe let everyone get new claims/accepted pops through events after conquering more stuff.
How to handle "disaster" scenarios? Through event chains?
