#Concepts
Add a decision to conquer the desert if two points are owned by a civ. Morocoo, Constantine,Nubia,etc
also add decisions to steal unciv lands (dinka outpost, timbuctu, tuat). Snarky message "what are you going to do about it?"

#add a similar conquest for Ashanti-Dahomey ewe lands
#allow aquire core on countries with a single state with non-core provinces

#add decision for Kong to later accept senufo, etc for Ashanti with ewe, fon (overkill-who will play them?)

#add mor-spa compromise, maybe similar for Ashanti, Nubia

France: Choose degree of original balkanisation. 4 Dutchies is less initial work
France:The default route is southern unification through Occitania.
This gives cores on Catalonia, Dauphine, (Vaskonia?)
Alternate route is northern unification through one of the dutchies. This
gives cores on Brittany, Picardy, Champagne.
Maybe all get cores on Champagne?
Cultures, French-Breton, Occitan-Catalan for sure. Dauphine(?), Picardois(?) for extra claims?
Maybe let everyone get new claims/accepted pops through events after conquering more stuff.
How to handle "disaster" scenarios? Through event chains?
